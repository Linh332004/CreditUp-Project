# CreditUp-Project
CreditUp is a web application that helps assess the creditworthiness of young users who lack traditional credit history by using behavioral and academic data inputs. It combines **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process)** and **Fuzzy Evaluation** techniques to return a comprehensive credit score and personalized advice.
